# 🎁 Prizes

At Assemble, we kept prizes small & numerous. We wanted attendees to feel motivated to build an awesome project but for the hackathon to remain friendly & collaborative at the same time.

Here are the prizes we offered:

| Item |Quantity  |
|--|--|
|⏺️ Useless Box Kit (Solarbotics)  | 4 |
|🔮 Circuit Playground Express - Base Kit (Adafruit)  | 4 |
|🚀 Space Shuttle Discovery Solder Kit by Phyx (Adafruit)  | 8 |
|📺 TV-B-Gone Kit - Universal v1.2 (Adafruit)  | 4 |
|🔌 Day of the Geek Soldering Badge Kit (Pimoroni)  | 16 |
|⚡ Orpheus Leaps  | 40 |
|🤩 Orpheus Plushies  | 20 |
|🧊 Hack Cubes & Fidget Spinners  | 40 |
|🌝 Assorted NASA Flight Memorabilia  | 8 |

As you can see, we had a ton of prizes! We ended up giving everyone who attended a prize, with the smaller prizes going to those who didn't win an award at the event (we had to reuse some event supplies such as workshops hardware as prizes to cover every attendee).
