# 🏦 Our Bank Account

For teenagers, money is tough. The banking system is a convoluted mess and getting legal status can take months. That's why we used [HCB](https://hackclub.com/bank) to run Assemble. HCB, which was built by Hack Club, enabled us to do the following with just 30 minutes of setup:

- Issue debit cards (both virtual & physical) to each member of our team. We used these debit cards to spend money!
- Send ACH transfers. We used these to reimburse attendees with [a travel stipend](/the-attendees/stipends) for their flights.
- Open source our finances at [bank.hackclub.com/assemble](https://bank.hackclub.com/assemble).
- Send emails to our attendees using HCB's instance of [Sendy](https://sendy.co).
- Generate [legal waivers for attendees](/further-reading/waiver.pdf).

Without Bank, money would have been a massive pain in the neck for our team. It truly is a godsend.
